--- 'pbdMPI' Installation:
   See 'pbdMPI/INSTALL' for the details.


--- 'pbdSLAP' Installation:
0. Download and extract 'pbdSLAP'

     > tar zxvf pbdSLAP_0.1-0.tar.gz

1. Default Installation:
   This should work with most platforms with OpenMPI installed. The
   configuration is based on Rmpi but detect the flags and libraries from
   'mpicc --showme:*' which is more portable.

     > R CMD INSTALL pbdSLAP


--- Testing:
   Suppose 'pbdMPI' and 'pbdSLAP' are installed correctly. I can run

     > mpiexec -np 2 Rscript -e "demo(gridinfo,'pbdSLAP',ask=F,echo=F)"
