### This file is a quick installation for Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X.
### See `INSTALL.win.src' for a source installation for Windows system.
### See `INSTALL.win.bin' for a binary installation for Windows system.

--- 'pbdMPI' Installation:
   See 'pbdMPI/INSTALL' for the details.


--- 'pbdSLAP' Installation:
0. Download and extract 'pbdSLAP'

     > tar zxvf pbdSLAP_*.*-*.tar.gz

1. Default Installation:
   This should work with most platforms with OpenMPI installed. The
   configuration is based on Rmpi but detect the flags and libraries from
   'mpicc --showme:*' which is more portable.

     > R CMD INSTALL pbdSLAP


--- Testing:
   Suppose 'pbdMPI' and 'pbdSLAP' are installed correctly. I can run

     > mpiexec -np 2 Rscript -e "demo(gridinfo,'pbdSLAP',ask=F,echo=F)"


### `INSTALL.win.src'.

--- 'pbdMPI' Installation:
   See 'pbdMPI/INSTALL.win.src' for the details.

--- 'pbdSLAP' Installation:
   Default Installation:
   ("set_mpisrc.bat" is available in "pbdMPI/INSTALL.win.bin")

     C:/> set_mpisrc
     C:/> tar zxvf pbdSLAP_*.*-*.tar.gz
     C:/> R CMD INSTALL --build pbdSLAP
     C:/> R CMD INSTALL pbdSLAP_*.*-*.zip

--- Testing:
   Suppose all environments are set correctly, I can run test examples by

   -- 64-bits
     C:/> set_mpisrc 64
     C:/> mpiexec -np 2 Rscript.exe -e "demo(gridinfo,'pbdSLAP',ask=F,echo=F)"
   -- 32-bits
     C:/> set_mpisrc 32
     C:/> mpiexec -np 2 Rscript.exe -e "demo(gridinfo,'pbdSLAP',ask=F,echo=F)"


### `INSTALL.win.bin'.

--- 'pbdMPI' Installation:

     C:/> set_mpi
     C:/> R CMD INSTALL pbdSLAP_*.*-*.zip

--- Testing:
   Suppose all environments are set correctly, I can run test examples by
